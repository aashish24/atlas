Atlas is a ECMWF library for parallel data-structures supporting unstructured
grids and function spaces, with the aim to investigate alternative more scalable
dynamical core options for Earth System models, and to support modern interpolation
and product generation software
@endparblock

Atlas is predominantly C++ code, with main features available to Fortran codes
through a F2003 interface. It requires some flavour of Unix (such as Linux).
It is known to run on a number of systems, some of which are directly supported
by ECMWF.
